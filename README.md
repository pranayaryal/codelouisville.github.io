========================

This is Code Louisville's uncompiled Jekyll source code.

Code Louisville is built on Jekyll and some other stuff that is yet to be determined. Bear with us as we build this out.

## Dependencies

We're going to be using Bower for package management (Bourbon, Neat, etc) and Grunt (a task runner for CSS, JS, and other things). Before contributing to the project, make sure you become familair with both.
