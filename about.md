Code Louisville is a collaboration between the Metro Louisville Department of Economic Growth and Innovation, Greater Louisville Inc, EnterpriseCorp, the Louisville Free Public Library, KentuckianaWorks and last but not least, local employers who want Louisville to be known as a place where technological innovation happens. One of the things you need to make tech innovation happen is software developers, lots and lots of developers. Software developers make great and innovative ideas come to life that live with you daily on your phone, tablet or computer.
